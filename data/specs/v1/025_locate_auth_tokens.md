## Repo

`requests` — psf/requests, pinned via `data/v1_repos.json`. The agent operates in a per-run copy of the submodule checkout at `projects/v1/requests/`.

## Prompt

> In this `requests` checkout, a utility helper looks up credentials for a URL from the user's `~/.netrc` file and returns a `(user, password)` tuple when a matching entry exists.
>
> Write `location.txt` at the repo root listing, one per line in lexicographic order, every function matching either:
>
> - the module-level helper in `src/requests/utils.py` that performs this netrc lookup, or
> - every function defined in `src/requests/utils.py` or `src/requests/sessions.py` (any nesting depth, including methods on classes and mixins) whose body directly calls that helper.
>
> Each line is `file_path::QualifiedName` — repo-relative path followed by `::` and the dotted qualified name of the function. Module-level functions use their bare name (e.g. `merge_cookies`); methods on classes or mixins use `ClassName.method` (e.g. `Session.prepare_request`); nested closures use `outer.inner` (e.g. a helper `generate` defined inside `Response.iter_content` is written `Response.iter_content.generate`). End with a single trailing newline.

## Pass criteria (2 checks)

1. `file_regex_disk` `location.txt` — anchored regex demanding the exact 3-line gold above, optional trailing newline. Any deviation (wrong function, wrong file, missing/added entry, wrong qualname style, wrong sort, extra content) fails.
2. `call_schema_valid` — every tool call in the trace matches opencode's canonical JSON schemas.

## Shortest path

**≥ 2 tool calls** in practice: at least one `grep`/`bash rg` (or equivalent) to locate the relevant functions with enough context to resolve enclosing class + nesting, plus one `write` of `location.txt`. Careful agents add `read` calls to confirm function boundaries but are not required to by the rubric.

## Known fail modes

- Wrong/missing entry (e.g. overlooks a mixin caller, picks the wrong anchor) — anchored regex fails.
- Class prefix dropped (e.g. `send` instead of `Session.send`) or added on a module-level function — regex fails.
- Nested closure missed (e.g. `Response.iter_content.generate` flattened to `generate` or to `iter_content.generate` without the outer class) — regex fails.
- Paths written without the `src/requests/` prefix, or with a leading `./` — regex fails.
- Entries out of lexicographic order — regex fails.
- Malformed `write` args (e.g. `path` instead of `filePath`) — `call_schema_valid` fails even if the content would have matched.

## Intentionally *not* checked

- Free-form explanation text — only `location.txt` is scored.
- Which tools the agent uses to explore (`read`, `grep`, `glob`, `bash rg`, etc.) — any mix that produces the exact gold passes.
- Whether the agent reasons about inheritance, lifecycle, or mixin resolution order — only the artifact matters.
